Here is a simple interactive JavaScript code for the website:

**index.html**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Kahve MarkasÄ± iÃ§in Modern Web Sitesi</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script src="index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
**index.js**
```javascript
console.log("Kahve markasÄ± iÃ§in modern web sitesi yÃ¼klendi!");

// Interaktif kodlar burada baÅŸlayacak!
```
This code simply logs the message "Kahve markasÄ± iÃ§in modern web sitesi yÃ¼klendi!" to the console when the page is loaded. The rest of the JavaScript code is left empty, ready for you to add interactive features and functionalities as needed.

To use this code, create a new HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) and paste the above code into it. Then, create a separate JavaScript file (e.g., `index.js`) and paste the code above into it. Link the JavaScript file to the HTML file using the `<script>` tag, as shown in the example.

Run the HTML file by opening it in a web browser or using a local development server, and you should see the message logged to the console when the page loads!
